# Mensa Uniurb API #
This simple API written in flask wraps the ERSU menu directly from their webpage.

# Usage #
You can access all data using:
    `X.X.X.X:9543/<kitchen>/<date>/<moment>

* `kitchen`: `duca`, `tridente`
* `date`: date in format MM-DD-YYYY
* `moment`: `lunch` or `dinner`

Some other methods are ready but are disabled on the page, maybe will be re-enabled in the future.
